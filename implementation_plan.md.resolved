# Machine Learning Internship Project Proposals

The dynamic generated [simulations_master.csv](file:///d:/DeepMost/DeepMost_Agentic_SDR/data/processed/simulations_master.csv) dataset contains rich records of AI-to-AI sales conversations, including the company context, the full dialogue history, and the final analytical outcome (booking success, key objections, sentiment). 

Because this is clean, highly structured data, it is perfect for an internship project. Here are three high-impact Machine Learning ideas you can build using this exact dataset without needing any further data collection:

## 1. Early Call Success Prediction (Classification)
**The Concept**: Build a model that can predict the final `outcome` of the call (e.g., "Meeting Booked" vs. "Rejected" vs. "Nurture") by only looking at the **first 2-3 exchanges** of the conversation.
**The Value**: In a real business, this acts as a real-time dialer assistant. If the model detects the call is 90% likely to fail after 30 seconds, it tells the SDR to cut their losses and move on.
**The Tech Stack**:
- **Baseline**: TF-IDF vectorization of the text + XGBoost or Random Forest classification.
- **Advanced**: Fine-tune a pre-trained transformer model like RoBERTa or DistilBERT for sequence classification.
- **Metrics to show off**: ROC-AUC curves, Precision/Recall, and a Confusion Matrix.

## 2. SDR Copilot: Real-Time Objection Handler (Generative RAG/Fine-tuning)
**The Concept**: Build an AI copilot that reads the prospect's last statement (specifically objections) and instantly suggests the statistically best rebuttal for the SDR to say next.
**The Value**: A live coaching tool for junior sales reps.
**The Tech Stack**: 
- **Approach A (Fine-Tuning)**: Take a small open-source LLM (like Llama-3 8B or Mistral 7B) and fine-tune it (using QLoRA) on the successful conversations in your dataset.
- **Approach B (RAG)**: Embed the successful dialogues using ChromaDB/FAISS. When a new objection comes in, retrieve the closest matching successful rebuttal and display it.
- **Metrics to show off**: BLEU/ROUGE scores for generation quality, or a working Streamlit/Gradio UI demo.

## 3. Automated CRM Data Extraction (NLP / Named Entity Recognition)
**The Concept**: SDRs hate doing manual data entry after a call. Build a model that takes the raw `conversation_history` transcript and automatically extracts the structured metadata: the prospect's `Sentiment`, the `Key_Objection`, and the final `Outcome`.
**The Value**: Massive time-savings for sales teams by automating Salesforce/CRM data entry.
**The Tech Stack**:
- Fine-tune a smaller LLM or use BERT-based token classification to reliably map the unstructured text into a strict JSON schema. 
- Build a pipeline that shows the raw transcript going in, and the perfect JSON payload coming out.

> [!TIP]
> **Recommendation for an Internship**: 
> **Idea #1 (Early Call Success Prediction)** is the most rigorous "traditional" data science project. It allows you to build charts, graphs, and prove hard statistical accuracy. 
> **Idea #2 (SDR Copilot)** is the most visually impressive and trendy. Being able to say you "fine-tuned an LLM" or "built a RAG system" is highly sought after by recruiters right now. 

## Next Steps
Review these three proposals. Which one sounds the most exciting to you? Once you decide, we can start writing the Python scripts to preprocess your CSV data specifically for that model architecture!
