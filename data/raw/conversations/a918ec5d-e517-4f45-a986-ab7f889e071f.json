  "company_context": "Basecamp — Project management software, online collaboration We’d like to use cookies to help understand if our ads are working or not. No Yes, that’s fine Wrestling with projects? It doesn’t have to be this hard. There are lots of ways to manage projects. And there’s plenty of software promising to help. You’ve probably tried some. Yet, here you are. Unfortunately, most project management systems are either overwhelming, inadequate, bewildering, or chaotic. You know? Not Basecamp. Basecamp is refreshingly straightforward, with a 21-year track record to back it up. Longevity isn’t luck — it’s proof it works. And you’ll work better with it too. Basecamp is famously no-nonsense, effective, and reliable. The trifecta. It’s designed for smaller, hungrier businesses , not big, sluggish ones. Over 30 pages of customer testimonials detail how things run better on Basecamp. So, we invite you to poke around, watch the video below, and try Basecamp for free . We’d be honored to have you as a customer. Thank you. Jason Fried , jason@basecamp.com Co-founder & CEO Hit play to see how Basecamp is different Let’s walk through it. 10 seconds after you sign up, clarity sets in. The home screen organizes your projects, assignments, and upcoming events together on one screen. It’s your calm, comfortable, simple starting point every morning. What’s my week look like? What’s on my plate today? Each person gets their own home screen depending on which projects they have access to. They’ll only see their own assignments and events. And you can keep important projects close at hand by pinning them to the top. Which projects am I on? Projects get teams — and keep teams — organized. A project is where the tasks, discussions, deliverables, and decisions happen. Projects hold everything — and everyone — together in one tidy, predictably structured place. A project page organizes everything Make as many projects as you’d like. We run dozens at once in our own Basecamp account. For example, one for a web site redesign, one for planning an upcoming offsite , one for working with our accountants, and one just for the executive team to plan strategy, etc. What to do + who’s doing? Who said what when? What’s due next? Where’s the latest version? Got a quick question? How’s the process flowing? Reports give you confidence to hold people accountable. Basecamp’s reports aren’t numbers, percentages, or abstract representations — they’re the real work, actual evidence of progress being made (or not made). What’s overdue? How much time have we spent? Who’s responsible for what? What’s actually been happening? Visualizations are for seeing, not squinting. Basecamp’s Lineup, Mission Control, and Hill Charts are visual tools that help you clearly see where projects really stand. Notice progress at a glance, know reality in an instant. How far along are we? How are we feeling? What still needs to be figured out? Ping! Hey! It’s for you. The Hey! menu aggregates your notifications in a neve",
