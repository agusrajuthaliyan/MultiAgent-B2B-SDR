To fathom that WorkflowMax has built a like-for-like application in less than 12 months for companies like mine to transition to with next-to-no downtime is simply remarkable. Thank you to the WorkflowMax team. I can't wait to see where you guys take this platform! John Lelempsis I'm happy to say that the transition has been outstanding. The process was smooth with minimal downtime and no complaints from our team which is a good sign. The Xero integration remains seamless. Geetha Liyanaarachchi Amazing… The WorkflowMax guys were open, honest and transparent... I want to personally thank Chris, Ryan and the team. New product is already a step up and I can see how it’s going to be further improved. Hugh McKenzie WorkflowMax is a fantastic refresh of what is a great product. Will be recommending to others who want a great product at a price point much more competitive than other solutions I've used. Lachlan Smith Long time user of Workflowmax. Looked at many alternatives which either didn't have the features, or were ok but expensive... Yes, there are some minor features that aren't quite finished, but I'd sacrifice those for the easy transition any day of the week. Good Job. Mark Inman The updated UI and new features have streamlined our job management, providing a much smoother experience for our entire team. We’re also pleased to see that the Xero sync continues to operate as seamlessly as it did on the original WorkflowMax. Liam Edleston It was an easy migration process and we're up and running in the new WorkflowMax . Some work is still required but it works exactly the same and took minutes to migrate. Looking forward to seeing what's next. Brett Stockley Our firm looked at a number of alternatives that either didn’t offer the same functionalities that we required or were far more expensive... Very happy with the new product so far and excited to see what’s next as new features are added. Paralegal Sainty Law 40 user system here. Transition went exceptionally smoothly for us I’m blown away by what they have been able to achieve in such a short time, perhaps people don’t have an appreciation on how difficult it is to write good software quickly. Keep up the great work 😊 Cezar Trifoi The team had a big challenge to replace the old WorkflowMax from ground up in a relatively short time. Have been some teething problems but most of these are now resolved and team look committed to not only make this product as good as WorkflowMax but make it b",
