Humanitec makes sure they build right by enforcing security, cost, and compliance policies on every deployment. Try the sandbox Arrow Right Book a demo THE PROBLEM AI agents need infrastructure. Who is in control of what they get? AI agents don't just write code. They need infrastructure to run it. How your organization handles that request today falls into one of three traps. BLOCKED Agents can’t provision The agent finished the code before you finished your coffee. The infrastructure it needs is still waiting on a human. The AI advantage disappears one ticket at a time. ‍ The agent needs a database. The request waits three days in a queue. UNGOVERNED Agents provision, unsupervised Agents provision whatever works: admin-level roles, unencrypted storage, oversized instances. No audit trail. Your security risk and cloud bill grow with every deployment. ‍ The agent provisions instantly, but a database 10x the size it needs. BOTTLENECKED Allowed, but nothing ships without approval Agents can request, but a human must approve every single one. Five agents today, fifty next quarter. The platform team's review queue grows linearly with adoption. You didn't remove the bottleneck — you moved it. You adopted AI to move faster. Your platform team has never been slower. THE SOLUTION Humanitec lets AI agents provision infrastructure — within the rules your platform team defines. No tickets. No manual reviews. No surprises. Same rules, every request — human or AI. Learn more Arrow Right Book a demo Control without slowing agents down Progressive Rollouts Agent rolls out infra changes in waves, not all at once. Fails at 10%? Blast radius is 10% Impact Analysis Agent misconfigured something. See exactly what's affected and how big the mess is, in seconds Rollback Agent broke something. One command. Everything back to the last known-good state Drift Detection Agent changed something it shouldn't have. You'll know immediately Ephemeral Environments Agent spins up a full environment to validate, tears it down when done Learn more Arrow Right WHERE IT FITS The missing layer between who requests and what gets provisioned. You already have CI/CD, infrastructure as code, cloud accounts, and maybe a developer portal. Humanitec doesn’t replace any of it. It’s the orchestration and governance layer that connects them — ensuring every request, from any interface, is provisioned according to the same rules. One orchestration layer. Same rules, across every interface.
