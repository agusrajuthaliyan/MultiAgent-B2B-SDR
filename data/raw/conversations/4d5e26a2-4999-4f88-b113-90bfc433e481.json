DeepData AI is a specialized solution designed to process and secure vast amounts of data generated by AI agents, ensuring compliance and preventing unauthorized access. Given Okta's platform, we believe we can offer significant value in how you manage and audit that data flow.",

      "message": "\"Process and secure vast amounts of data\" sounds like a broad statement. We already have robust data governance in place, and frankly, our current infrastructure handles our needs. We're not looking to rip and replace anything significant right now, especially with major projects underway.",

DeepData AI doesn't aim to replace your core identity and access management, but rather to augment it, specifically for the unique challenges of AI-generated data. Think of it as a specialized layer for that specific risk profile, offering granular insights and control that traditional methods might miss. We've seen companies with Okta integrations achieve significant improvements in anomaly detection.",

And to be blunt, the integration complexity and cost associated with yet another platform are significant concerns for us at this stage. We're focused on optimizing our existing stack and have other strategic priorities that are more immediate.",

Perhaps we could schedule a brief 15-minute call next week to walk through a specific use case and demonstrate how DeepData AI would complement your Okta environment, highlighting the ROI?",
