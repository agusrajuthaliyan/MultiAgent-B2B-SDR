While FortiAI is an excellent solution, DeepData AI focuses specifically on data processing and analysis, providing a deeper level of insight into your organization's data. Our solution can help identify potential security risks that may not be immediately apparent, such as data exfiltration or insider threats. Additionally, our solution is designed to be highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data, making it an ideal fit for organizations like yours that are already invested in Fortinet's ecosystem.",
