I'm also concerned about the authority to make a decision like this - I'd need to get buy-in from our entire IT team, and that's a long process.

Our AI technology is specifically designed to handle complex data processing tasks, and we've seen significant improvements in accuracy and speed compared to other solutions on the market.
