I'm not sure if integrating a new solution like DeepData AI would be feasible, especially considering our IT team is already stretched thin. Not to mention, we've had some issues with vendor lock-in in the past, so I'd need to be convinced that your solution is flexible and adaptable.",

And to be frank, we're in the middle of a budget freeze right now, so even if I could approve it, I'm not sure we'd be able to allocate the funds.",
