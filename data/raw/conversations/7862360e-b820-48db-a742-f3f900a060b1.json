Experience real-time cloud security cortex WHY IT MATTERS OUR APPROACH MODULES RESOURCES WHY IT MATTERS OUR APPROACH MODULES RESOURCES Cloud-native applications are increasingly distributed across VMs, hosts, containers, Kubernetes ® and serverless architectures. Unique security requirements for each make consistent workload protection a challenge. Download the latest datasheet on Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) Download the Datasheet Environments are constantly evolving With DevOps teams deploying weekly, daily or even hourly, public and private cloud environments are constantly changing. Security teams struggle to gain control over these deployments without slowing down release velocity. The shift to the cloud means more entities to secure DevOps and infrastructure microservices teams are leveraging a combination of containers, Kubernetes and serverless functions to run cloud-native applications. This diversity, along with an ever-increasing cloud footprint, leads to a much larger number of entities to protect. Diverse architectures limit visibility and impede protections Enterprises use wide-ranging combinations of public and private clouds, cloud services and application architectures. These complex environments create blind spots and protection challenges for overworked security teams. Secure hosts, containers and serverless across multicloud and hybrid environments Prisma Cloud is a comprehensive Cloud Workload Protection solution that delivers flexible protection to secure cloud VMs, containers and Kubernetes apps, serverless functions and containerized offerings like AWS Fargate ® tasks. With Prisma Cloud, DevOps and cloud infrastructure teams can adopt the architecture that fits their needs without worrying about security keeping pace with release cycles or protecting a variety of tech stacks. Support for public and private clouds Flexible agentless scanning and agent-based protection Security integrated across the application lifecycle Vulnerability management Compliance CI/CD security Runtime defense Container access control Image Analysis Sandbox Trusted Images Web App and API Security Agentless and agent-based security THE PRISMA CLOUD SOLUTION Our approach to cloud workload protection Vulnerability management Securing cloud-native applications requires a comprehensive view into vulnerabilities across the application lifecycle. Prisma Cloud delivers a centralized view to help prioritize risks in real time across public cloud, private cloud and on-premises environments for every host, container and serverless function. Manage risk from a single UI. Prioritize risk across host OS, container images and serverless functions with intelligent risk scoring. See vulnerability status with rem",
