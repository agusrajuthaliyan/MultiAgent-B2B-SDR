Essentially, we accelerate the entire data pipeline, from ingestion to processing, significantly reducing time-to-insight and operational costs. Given your focus on compute and storage, I imagine data processing is a core concern.",

      "message": "That’s a fair question, Mr. Sharma. Many of our clients are already on platforms like OVHcloud, and they find our solution complements their existing infrastructure rather than replacing it. We specialize in the *intelligence* layer of data processing – think advanced feature engineering, anomaly detection within datasets, and even predictive analytics, all automated. For instance, clients using our platform have seen a 30-40% reduction in data preparation time for their ML models, which can be a huge bottleneck. We also offer a unique price-to-performance ratio that’s hard to match.",

Regarding pricing, it's a usage-based model that's very transparent and scalable. We actually have a free trial available with ₹18,000 in credits, similar to your public cloud credits, which would allow you to test our capabilities on your own data without any upfront commitment. I’d love to schedule a quick 15-minute demo to show you exactly how we achieve those reductions and how it would fit into your environment.",

Data processing optimization isn't a priority for us *right now*. Perhaps sometime down the line. Please send me an email with the details, and my team can review it.",
