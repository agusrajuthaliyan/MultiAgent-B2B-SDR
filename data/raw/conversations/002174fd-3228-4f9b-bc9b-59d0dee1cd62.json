We've found that our solution can actually help companies save money in the long run by reducing their infrastructure costs.

We've also got an existing relationship with another data processing vendor, and I'm not sure if it would be worth switching. Look, I appreciate the call, but why don't you just send me an email with some more information, and I'll take a look at it when I have some more time?",
