I came across your company and was really impressed by your focus on driving AI transformation, particularly how you're leveraging agentic automation. I wanted to reach out because we’ve been helping companies like yours significantly improve their data processing capabilities, which is often a bottleneck in scaling those AI initiatives.",

We’ve got agentic automation integrated into our workflows, and frankly, I’m not sure how much more we can really improve on the data processing side without a massive overhaul.",

      "message": "I completely understand, and UiPath is a formidable platform. That’s actually why I’m calling. We’re not looking to replace your existing automation infrastructure. Instead, think of DeepData AI as a specialized accelerator that seamlessly integrates *with* your UiPath environment. Many of our clients find that while UiPath excels at orchestrating those agentic workflows, the underlying data preparation and enrichment can become a bottleneck. We specialize in rapidly processing and structuring unstructured data, which then feeds directly into those UiPath agents, allowing them to operate more intelligently and efficiently.",

We've been burned by solutions that promise integration but end up requiring extensive custom development and introduce more points of failure. What’s the actual integration story here?

      "message": "That’s a very valid concern, and we’ve designed DeepData AI to address that head-on. Our integration with UiPath is built on their open APIs and is incredibly straightforward, often requiring minimal to no custom code. We can ingest data from your existing sources, apply advanced AI-powered processing, and then output it in a format that your UiPath robots can consume directly, dramatically reducing pre-processing time and manual effort. Regarding cost, we typically see a substantial ROI within months by reducing the time your teams spend on data wrangling and by enabling your agents to handle more complex tasks faster. We’ve seen clients like WEX, whom you might be familiar with, achieve significant savings by streamlining their operations with solutions like ours.",

My main concern is still how this actually *enhances* our existing agentic automation, not just adds another tool to the stack.",

Think of it this way: Your UiPath agents are the skilled workers, and DeepData AI is the ultra-efficient data preparation facility that ensures they have the highest quality raw materials to work with, instantly. We can ingest and process things like customer documents, sensor data, or unstructured text at a scale and speed that frees up your agents for higher-value decision-making and exception handling, not just data normalization. We have a number of case studies that detail how this augmentation has led to a measurable uplift in the performance of existing UiPath deployments.",
