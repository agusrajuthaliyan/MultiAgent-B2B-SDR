I saw that your company uses a significant number of Apple devices, and I was wondering if you'd be interested in learning more about how our solution can integrate with Jamf to enhance your data security and management.",

Our solution uses AI to help companies like yours make better decisions and improve their overall data security. We've had great success with similar companies in the past, and I think we could really help you guys out. Would you be open to a demo to see how it works?",

To be honest, our budget for new tools is pretty tight this quarter, and I don't think we'd be able to fit something like DeepData AI into our budget.

We have a few different plans to choose from, but for a company of your size, I think our enterprise plan would be the best fit. It's $50,000 per year, which works out to about $4,000 per month. We also offer discounts for long-term commitments, so if you were to sign a 2-year contract, we could give you 10% off the total price.",
