Close Search Login Sign up Login Sign Up Kurrent Platform Event-Centric Data Platform For Event Sourcing For Event-Driven Architecture For Event-Driven Microservices Replaces Change Data Capture Zero-Code Outbox Built-in Stream Processing (Almost) no Impedance Mismatch Get Started Run locally For Event Sourcing KurrentDB was purpose-built for event sourcing. Store events in individually indexed streams and replay them to reconstruct system state at any moment. Enjoy a globally ordered, immutable event log with lock-free appends and lightning-fast event retrieval per stream or across your entire system. For Event-Driven Architecture Seamlessly store, distribute, and react to events with no external message brokers required. With built-in connectors and persistent subscriptions, KurrentDB powers real-time event flows and automates message delivery out of the box. For Event-Driven Microservices Decouple, scale, and evolve your microservices. Persist state changes as events, enabling independent service evolution. Events can be consumed in real time or transformed via stream processing pipelines to generate new events or update materialized views. Replaces Change Data Capture No more CDC tools or complex infrastructure required. With KurrentDB, state changes are events. Subscribe to the event stream for direct, real-time access to all changes. Zero-Code Outbox Outbox pattern with zero code. KurrentDB natively ensures events and state changes are stored atomically and requires no separate outbox tables or extra libraries. Publish events reliably, with zero operational overhead. Built-in Stream Processing Process, transform, and semantically link events in real-time directly in your database. Think of it as stored procedures for event streams: triggered by new data, executed in-database, and optimized for millisecond-level latency. (Almost) no Impedance Mismatch Ensure your application logic aligns natively with stored data. KurrentDB persists state changes as simple, serializable event objects, which eliminates the need for object-relational mapping. KurrentDB Event-Native Database Model your business processes, not just the state of your business. KurrentDB's event-native data model directly reflects your domain model. Skip the complexity of ORMs, outboxes, and CDC. Gain complete visibility into how your data evolves, and stream events in real time—straight from the source.
