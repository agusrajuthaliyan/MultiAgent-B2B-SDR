While HubSpot is excellent for its core functions, we understand many companies like yours end up with data silos in other systems – marketing automation, ERP, maybe even legacy databases. DeepData AI acts as that intelligent layer that connects these, cleans them, and then surfaces insights you can act on, whether it's identifying customer churn risks or optimizing your marketing spend across channels.",
