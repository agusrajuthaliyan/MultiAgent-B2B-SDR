We're a data processing solution that helps companies like yours optimize their IT investments and improve cost transparency. I came across your company, Apptio, and was impressed with the work you're doing in IT financial management. Can you tell me a bit about your current data processing challenges?",

However, I have to say that our current priorities are focused on integrating our recent acquisition of Cloudability, so I'm not sure if we're in the market for a new data processing solution right now.",

Our solution, DeepData AI, is actually designed to help companies like yours streamline their data processing and improve cost optimization. We've had success with similar companies in the past, and I think we could really help you drive more value from your IT investments. Would you be open to a quick demo to see how our solution could help?",

Plus, we're already invested in our own IT financial management solutions, such as Apptio and Cloudability. I'm not sure how your solution would integrate with our existing stack, and I'd need to see some pretty compelling ROI to consider switching or adding a new vendor.",

We've actually worked with companies that use Apptio and Cloudability, and our solution can integrate seamlessly with those tools. In terms of ROI, we've seen our customers achieve significant cost savings and improved efficiency. I'd be happy to provide some case studies and references to demonstrate the value we can bring.",

We've got a lot of other priorities and initiatives that we need to fund, and I just can't justify that kind of expense for a solution that, while interesting, isn't a must-have for us right now. I think we're going to have to pass on DeepData AI.",
