I'm calling because we work with companies like Acquia to help them unlock deeper insights from their customer data, and I thought it might be relevant to your focus on driving engagement and optimizing conversions.",

Many of our clients use it to analyze user behavior across their digital experiences, identify patterns that lead to higher conversions, and even personalize content in real-time, which seems to align with what Acquia offers. We've seen clients reduce processing times by up to 70%.",

Our typical integration takes a matter of weeks, not months, and it's designed to work alongside your existing infrastructure, not replace it entirely. We focus on connecting to your data sources and then providing you with that accelerated processing and enhanced analytical capabilities. It’s about augmenting what you already have.",

Our focus is entirely on getting this platform upgrade live and stable. We’re extremely busy with that, and adding a new data processing initiative, regardless of its potential, would pull resources away from our critical path. We'll have to pass on exploring this further for now.",
