Plus, I've heard similar claims from other vendors, so I'd need to see some concrete proof of your solution's effectiveness. And to be honest, our budget for new tools is pretty tight this quarter.",

We've worked with several companies in similar situations, and our solution can actually help with system integration by providing more efficient data processing.

Our CFO handles all new tool acquisitions, and they're pretty strict about staying within our allocated budget. We also have existing contracts with other data processing vendors that we need to see through before considering new options.",
