I know you're incredibly busy, but I noticed IBM and AWS are heavily focused on accelerating data transformation and AI initiatives, which is exactly where we operate. We help companies, especially those scaling their AI on AWS, to streamline their data processing. I was curious if challenges around data velocity, governance, or optimizing costs for complex AI data pipelines are on your radar at all?\"",

What we're finding, even with those excellent tools, is that as data volumes and sources explode – especially for advanced AI workloads like those IBM is pushing with agentic AI – keeping a unified view for governance, ensuring data quality at scale, and optimizing cloud resource spend can become incredibly complex. For instance, are you consistently hitting your SLAs for data delivery to your AI pipelines, or seeing unexpected cloud costs related to data movement and processing across your various systems?\"",

Our AI-driven engine specifically identifies inefficiencies, automates data quality checks, and intelligently routes data for optimal processing, leading to a demonstrable 20-30% reduction in processing costs and significantly faster data-to-insight cycles without major refactoring. Many CTOs we speak with, even those well-integrated with AWS, are finding this level of optimization crucial as they push towards more ambitious AI projects.
