I came across Solo.io and was impressed with the work you're doing in reimagining infrastructure for cloud and AI. Can you tell me a little bit about your current data processing challenges?",

We've had success with similar companies in the past, and I think we could really help you optimize your data processing. Can I ask, what are your biggest pain points when it comes to data processing right now?",

We've built a lot of custom tools and workflows around our existing infrastructure, and I'm not sure how easily a new solution would fit in. We're also invested in open-source projects like Istio and Envoy, so anything we bring in would need to be compatible with those.",

We also offer a lot of flexibility in terms of customization and integration. In terms of cost, we offer a tiered pricing model that can scale with your needs. Would you like me to walk you through some case studies or demos to show you how our solution could work for you?",
