As for resources, we typically require a small team to oversee the transition, but our goal is to make it as painless as possible. In terms of cost, we're looking at a subscription-based model, with pricing starting at $50,000 per year.",

However, I'd argue that our AI-powered engine and dedicated support team set us apart from the competition. That being said, I can offer you a customized pricing plan that takes into account your specific needs and budget. Would you be open to exploring that further?",
