It continuously optimizes compute, storage and network resources in real time while enforcing policies, giving IT teams the trust and control to operate with confidence. Take the product tour Full-stack visibility Intelligent automation Performance assurance Full-stack visibility Turbonomic continuously analyzes applications, containers, VMs and infrastructure to map dependencies and resource flows. It surfaces risks before they impact performance and provides data-driven actions for workload right-sizing, capacity modeling and policy-compliant scaling decisions. Learn more Intelligent automation and action Turbonomic doesn’t stop at recommendations. It executes safe, policy-driven actions across hybrid and multicloud. From pod scaling in Kubernetes to VM placement in VMware, every action is auditable and enables IT teams to operate at enterprise scale without manual intervention. Learn more Performance assurance at scale Turbonomic aligns compute, storage, network and GPU resources with live demand to keep workloads within SLOs. By preventing resource contention, rebalancing workloads and right-sizing resources in real time, it assures consistent application performance under dynamic conditions. Learn more How Turbonomic powers key IT operations Turbonomic addresses key IT challenges across hybrid and multicloud environments by applying real-time, application-aware automation. From private data centers to public cloud and container platforms, it ensures that resources are continuously optimized and managed for demand. Each of the highlighted use-cases demonstrates how Turbonomic scales intelligent actions to maintain efficiency, control and assure performance. Data center management Data center optimization Continuously monitors VMs and servers to right-size workloads, optimize server density, reclaim unused capacity and maintain consistent application performance under dynamic loads. Kubernetes optimization Kubernetes cost optimization Analyzes pod and container workloads in real time, automatically right-sizing and scaling them to prevent overprovisioning, reduce cluster costs and maintain stable, predictable performance. Cloud optimization Cloud performance optimization Monitors workload demand in real time across hybrid and public clouds, automatically right-sizing compute, storage and network resources to eliminate overprovisioning and assure performance.

I know you're incredibly busy, but I wanted to reach out because we've been helping companies like yours, especially those managing complex hybrid and multicloud environments, to significantly streamline their data processing and unlock deeper insights from their data. Is this a good time for a quick, two-minute chat?",

      "message": "That's a fair question, Alex. And I completely understand the data platform fatigue. What differentiates DeepData AI is our focus on *actionable* insights derived directly from your raw data, in real-time. While Turbonomic is brilliant at optimizing resource *allocation* for performance and cost, DeepData AI focuses on extracting predictive and prescriptive intelligence *from* that data to drive your business outcomes. Think of it as the next layer of intelligence on top of what you're already optimizing.",

      "message": "Excellent point about integration. We’ve designed DeepData AI with extensibility in mind. It integrates seamlessly with your existing data lakes and cloud storage, leveraging the infrastructure you already have. For instance, we can ingest the performance metrics that Turbonomic is already collecting, but then apply AI to predict potential application performance degradation *before* it impacts your SLOs, or identify patterns in customer behavior that your current analytics might miss. It’s not about replacing your existing tools, but augmenting them with a layer of predictive intelligence that drives proactive decision-making.",

For example, by accurately predicting customer churn based on usage patterns, or optimizing marketing spend by identifying high-potential segments, we’ve seen clients achieve anywhere from 15-30% improvement in those specific areas, beyond infrastructure cost savings. We typically see a clear ROI within the first year.
