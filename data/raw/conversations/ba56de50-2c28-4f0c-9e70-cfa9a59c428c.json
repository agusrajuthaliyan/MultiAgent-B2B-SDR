We're indeed focused on our mission, but I'm not sure how a data processing solution like DeepData AI fits into our priorities. We're a relatively small team, and our current data needs are managed internally. What makes you think we need an external solution like yours?",

Many organizations, especially those with a strong online presence like GetWisdom.com, often find that their internal data management systems become outdated or insufficient as they grow. DeepData AI can help you scale more efficiently, reduce manual data processing time, and provide more accurate insights to inform your decisions. We've had success with similar companies in the spiritual and wellness space.",

We're in the middle of several critical projects, including launching a new series of weekly broadcasts and enhancing our subscription services. Taking on a new technology implementation right now would be a significant distraction. And to be honest, we've had mixed experiences with AI solutions in the past, so we're cautious about adopting another one.",

However, I believe DeepData AI could offer long-term benefits that outweigh the short-term implementation challenges. Perhaps we could schedule a follow-up conversation for when your current projects are less intense? In the meantime, I could provide some case studies of similar companies that have successfully integrated our solution.",

Thank you for understanding, and I wish you the best in finding other opportunities.",
