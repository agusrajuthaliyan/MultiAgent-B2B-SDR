      "message": "That's a great question, John. While those companies do offer data processing solutions, they often require a lot of customization and integration work, which can be time-consuming and expensive. DeepData AI, on the other hand, is designed to be plug-and-play, with pre-built integrations for popular design and development tools like Figma. We also offer a more flexible pricing model that's based on actual usage, rather than a flat fee. And, we've had great success with similar companies in the past, with an average ROI of 300% within the first 6 months.",
