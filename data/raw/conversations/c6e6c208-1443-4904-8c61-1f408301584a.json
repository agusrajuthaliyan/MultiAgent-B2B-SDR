  "company_context": "Deploy app servers close to your users · Fly Open main menu Build fast. Run any code fearlessly. The platform for devs who just want to ship. Powered by sandboxes that let you deploy any code with confidence. Deploy your app Modern Compute Without the Complexity For builders who need compute that keeps up with their ideas, Fly Machines are hardware-virtualized containers that launch instantly and run only when you need them. Deploy an app in minutes or run untrusted code in isolated sandboxes. Sandboxes That Feel Like a Superpower Spin up hardware-isolated sandboxes for running AI-generated code in complete safety. Every Sprite is a self-contained environment, ready for action in under a second. Checkpoint your entire environment, run anything, and restore if you break something. Pay only for actual CPU and memory consumption, down to the second. Check Em Out! Storage That Keeps Up Fast local NVMe for low-latency work, plus global, durable object storage for data that needs to stick around. Snapshot environments, persist state, and scale storage right alongside your sandboxes. Built-In Private Networking Private networks per sandbox, granular routing, and end-to-end encryption — all automatic. VMs That Do Everything You Need Everything runs on Machines: your apps, agents that scale to millions of users, and AI-generated code. Fork Off VMs Like They're Processes Fly Machines start fast enough to handle HTTP requests, run only when you need them, and scale into tens of thousands of instances. Built for Distributed Systems Run clustered databases like Cockroach, globally-distributed Postgres, and modern RPC systems like Elixir FLAME. No Terraform required. Get Right in Your Users' Faces Deploy in 18 regions, from Sydney to São Paulo. Sub-100ms response times give users that native-app feel, no matter where they are. Use the Tech You Love Build with your favorite framework. No Dockerfile? No problem: our CLI generates containers for most popular frameworks, including Rails, Phoenix, Django, Node, Laravel, and .NET. Learn More Phoenix Framework SvelteKit Ruby on Rails Docker Django Laravel NextJS Agents Run Better on Sprites You don't have to be a cloud guru to build scalable agents. Run every instance on its own VM with dedicated CPU, memory, networking, and a private filesystem. Forget wrestling with shared runtimes or noisy neighbors. Get persistent brains when you need them, ephemeral workers when you don't.
