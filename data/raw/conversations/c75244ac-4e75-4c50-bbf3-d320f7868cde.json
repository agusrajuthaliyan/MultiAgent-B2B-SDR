Weave an invisible, intelligent layer of defense into every creation. Explore the platform Play Video: Snyk AI Security Fabric You're shipping risk at record speeds AI-driven development has put code velocity into overdrive, but 48% of AI-gen code is insecure. Speed without security means insecure code is being introduced faster than ever before. Attackers are accelerating Time-to-exploit (TTE) is shrinking fast. AI-enabled attackers are exploiting vulnerabilities across traditional and emerging attack surfaces, and TTE is expected to accelerate by 50% by 2027. Your AI features are now attack vectors AI-native components are being embedded into applications everywhere. Pair that with existing vulnerabilities, and attackers can exploit the access and power of AI itself — compounding risk in ways we've never seen. The Snyk AI Security Platform Snyk’s AI-native and agentic platform helps organizations secure and govern development to unleash productivity, reduce business risk, and accelerate software delivery for the age of AI.
