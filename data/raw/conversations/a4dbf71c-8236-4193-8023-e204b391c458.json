The reason for my call is that we've seen significant cost savings and performance improvements for companies in your industry by optimizing their unstructured data analysis.

We already have teams dedicated to this, and we're using a combination of internal tools and some off-the-shelf analytics platforms.

What sets DeepData AI apart is our proprietary processing engine that can ingest and analyze millions of data points from disparate sources – think customer feedback, social media sentiment, operational logs – in near real-time. This allows for proactive adjustments to pricing, flight schedules, and even identifying potential disruptions before they impact operations, leading to millions in potential revenue and cost avoidance. Regarding investment, our typical enterprise-level solution, tailored to an airline of your scale, starts in the [mention a high, but not astronomical, price range, e.g., low six figures] annually.",

We've just completed our IT budget for the next fiscal year, and frankly, that level of expenditure for a solution we haven't fully vetted and that requires integration with our existing systems is a tough pill to swallow right now. We're also exploring options with a competitor who has been doing some impressive work in the predictive maintenance space, which is a higher priority for us at the moment.",

And while predictive maintenance is important, the ability to unify and analyze *all* your data provides a much broader strategic advantage, impacting revenue across the board, not just in operational costs. We've found that even when budgets are tight, the ROI from DeepData AI often justifies the investment within the first year. Perhaps we could schedule a brief, 15-minute demo for you and your relevant team members to showcase the specific capabilities and potential ROI in a tangible way?",

However, even with a strong ROI case, the upfront cost is simply too high for us to consider at this time, especially with our current budget constraints and other prioritized initiatives.
