More info Meet the driving forces behind Jenkins as we showcase the top contributors shaping the future of continuous integration and delivery. More info Jenkins Stories! We are looking for experiences of Jenkins users from around the world showcasing how they are building, deploying, and automating great software with Jenkins. Check out their user stories and share yours More info Participate and Contribute! Jenkins is a community-driven project. We invite everyone to join us and move it forward. Any contribution matters: code, documentation, localization, blog posts, artwork, meetups, and anything else. If you have five minutes or a few hours, you can help! More info Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery As an extensible automation server, Jenkins can be used as a simple CI server or turned into the continuous delivery hub for any project. Easy installation Jenkins is a self-contained Java-based program, ready to run out-of-the-box, with packages for Windows, Linux, macOS and other Unix-like operating systems. Easy configuration Jenkins can be easily set up and configured via its web interface, which includes on-the-fly error checks and built-in help. Plugins With hundreds of plugins in the Update Center, Jenkins integrates with practically every tool in the continuous integration and continuous delivery toolchain. Extensible Jenkins can be extended via its plugin architecture, providing nearly infinite possibilities for what Jenkins can do. Distributed Jenkins can easily distribute work across multiple machines, helping drive builds, tests and deployments across multiple platforms faster.

Two days, hundreds of conversations, one booth, and just enough coffee and beer to get through the weekend. This year at FOSDEM 2026, I had the privilege of standing behind th",

For instance, are you currently able to automatically identify the root cause of flaky tests across your entire Jenkins history, or predict potential deployment failures before they happen based on historical build metrics? We've seen companies reduce their data processing time by up to 70% and uncover critical issues that were previously invisible.",

We also offer flexible pricing models tailored to your data volume. To address your skepticism, I'd love to show you a brief, 15-minute demo specifically focused on how we could analyze your Jenkins data. We could even run a sample analysis on a subset of your anonymized build logs to demonstrate the insights we can uncover. How about we schedule that for Tuesday morning?",
