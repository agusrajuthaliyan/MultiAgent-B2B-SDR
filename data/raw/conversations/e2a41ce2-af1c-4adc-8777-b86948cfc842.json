We're a data processing solution that helps companies like yours optimize their data infrastructure and improve performance. I came across your company and noticed you're using Akamai, but I saw that you're experiencing some access denied errors. Can you tell me a bit more about what's going on with that?",

DeepData AI uses machine learning to analyze your data traffic and detect patterns that might be causing the issues.

We've worked with many companies who have similar setups to yours, and our solution has been able to identify issues that their internal teams missed. As for cost, we offer a customized pricing model that's based on your specific usage and needs. I'd be happy to set up a demo and show you how our solution can work for you, and then we can discuss pricing. Would you be available for a 30-minute demo next week?",
