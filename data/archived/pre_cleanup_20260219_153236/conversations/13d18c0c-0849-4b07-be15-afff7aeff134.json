Buy your ticket now! 23 - 26 March | Amsterdam, The Netherlands Production-Grade Container Orchestration Learn Kubernetes Basics Kubernetes , also known as K8s, is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google , combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community. Planet scale Designed on the same principles that allow Google to run billions of containers a week, Kubernetes can scale without increasing your operations team. Never outgrow Whether testing locally or running a global enterprise, Kubernetes flexibility grows with you to deliver your applications consistently and easily no matter how complex your need is. Run K8s anywhere Kubernetes is open source giving you the freedom to take advantage of on-premises, hybrid, or public cloud infrastructure, letting you effortlessly move workloads to where it matters to you.

The Absolute Beginner's Guide To Cloud Native by Kyle Penfound, Dagger & Cortney Nickerson, Kubeshop Watch Video Attend upcoming KubeCon + CloudNativeCon events Europe (Amsterdam, Mar 23-26, 2026) North America (Salt Lake City, Nov 9-12, 2026) Kubernetes Features Automated rollouts and rollbacks Kubernetes progressively rolls out changes to your application or its configuration, while monitoring application health to ensure it doesn't kill all your instances at the same time. If something goes wrong, Kubernetes will rollback the change for you. Take advantage of a growing ecosystem of deployment solutions. Service discovery and load balancing No need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them. Storage orchestration Automatically mount the storage system of your choice, whether from local storage, a public cloud provider, or a network storage system such as iSCSI or NFS. Secret and configuration management Deploy and update Secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your image and without exposing Secrets in your stack configuration. Automatic bin packing Automatically places containers based on their resource requirements and other constraints, while not sacrificing availability. Mix critical and best-effort workloads in order to drive up utilization and save even more resources. Batch execution In addition to services, Kubernetes can manage your batch and CI workloads, replacing containers that fail, if desired. Self-healing Kubernetes restarts containers that crash, replaces entire Pods where n",

      "message": "I completely understand your skepticism. However, our solution is designed to complement Kubernetes, not replace it. DeepData AI helps with data processing and optimization, which can be a challenge even with Kubernetes. Our AI-powered engine can automatically detect and optimize data workflows, reducing latency and increasing throughput. We've seen companies like yours achieve up to 30% reduction in data processing time. Would you be open to exploring how our solution can help your team?",

      "message": "That's a fair concern. Our solution is designed to be Kubernetes-agnostic, meaning it can integrate with your existing setup without requiring significant changes. We also offer a comprehensive support package, including dedicated onboarding, training, and 24/7 technical support. We've worked with several companies in the cloud-native space, and our average deployment time is less than 2 weeks. I'd be happy to provide some case studies and references from our existing customers if that would help alleviate some of your concerns.",

As for pricing, we offer a tiered model based on data volume and processing requirements. We've found that our solution typically pays for itself within 6-12 months through improved efficiency and reduced infrastructure costs. I can also offer a pilot program to test our solution with a small subset of your data workflows, so you can see the benefits firsthand before committing to a full deployment. Would that be something you'd be interested in exploring further?",
