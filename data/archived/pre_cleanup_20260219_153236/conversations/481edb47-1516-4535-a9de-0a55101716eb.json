Our platform uses AI-powered processing to uncover hidden insights and patterns in your data, which can help you make more informed decisions.

We've developed a native connector that allows for seamless integration with your existing Elasticsearch cluster. Our solution can ingest data from Elasticsearch, process it using our AI-powered algorithms, and then write the results back to your Elasticsearch index. This allows you to leverage the power of DeepData AI while still utilizing your existing Elasticsearch investment. As for our AI-powered processing, it's not meant to replace your team, but rather augment their capabilities. Our platform can handle large volumes of data and perform complex processing tasks much faster and more accurately than human engineers. We've seen companies achieve significant reductions in data processing time and costs by using our solution.
