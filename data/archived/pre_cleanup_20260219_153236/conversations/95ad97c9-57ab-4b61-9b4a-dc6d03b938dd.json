Many CTOs I speak with have invested heavily in custom ETL, but still struggle with scaling data ingestion, integrating disparate or messy data sources, or keeping up with data governance mandates. Are those areas your team has completely optimized, or do you still face some bottlenecks there?\"",

Our platform uses explainable AI models to intelligently automate the *most tedious* parts of data prep, like schema inference across disparate sources or identifying PII for compliance, while keeping your team in full control and visibility. It integrates with your existing infrastructure, enhancing your data governance, not replacing it. Would you be open to a brief 15-minute screen share next week? I could quickly demo how our platform specifically tackles a compliance-focused data integration scenario, which might resonate with your team's challenges.\"",
