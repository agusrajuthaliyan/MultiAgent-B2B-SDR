Stay in the flow From GitHub , Slack , Jira , and Linear to coding agents with Sentry's MCP server , Sentry brings full context to every fix from dev to prod. Everything’s connected Yeah, other tools exist. But errors , logs , replays , spans , profiles , and metrics — all connected by the same trace? That’s kind of our thing. Go from Issue → Context → Fix. Go from Issue → Context → Fix. Debug 500's, trace slow requests, replay fetch() failures, and fix the broken code that caused it. Catch slow queries, N+1s, and request timeouts before the ‘why is this so slow?’ posts fill up your feed. Map every incident to the release, PR, and owner -- automatically. Debugging needs context— with or without AI Seer , our AI debugger, uses Sentry context – logs, commits, traces, stack trace - so you can stop guessing and it can fix issues for you. Analyzes every signal to explain why your code failed, not just where. Fixes what’s broken while you ship what’s next – generating precise, merge-ready patches. Stops bad code before it starts bad days. Correlating PRs against real error and performance history to catch regressions before they ship. Loved by developers worldwide We wouldn’t have scaled without Sentry. Most of our incidents are hardware-related—and we debug them all inside Sentry Nova DasSarma Systems Lead, Anthropic Sentry’s high-quality tooling helps Disney+ maintain high-quality service to its tens of millions of global subscribers.
