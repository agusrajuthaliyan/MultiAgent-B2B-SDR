I saw that Lattice is a G2 2026 Best Software Awards winner, and I was wondering if you're currently using any data processing solutions to support your HR platform?",

While Lattice is a great HR platform, it's primarily focused on managing HR functions, not optimizing data processing. Our solution, DeepData AI, can help you unlock more insights from your HR data, such as employee engagement, performance, and compensation. We've seen companies like yours reduce manual data processing time by up to 70% and make more data-driven decisions.",

What sets us apart is our ability to integrate with existing HR systems like Lattice, and provide advanced analytics and machine learning capabilities to help you uncover hidden insights in your data. For example, we can help you identify trends in employee turnover, or predict which employees are at risk of leaving. We've also worked with several companies in the HR space, and we've seen significant ROI from our solution.",
