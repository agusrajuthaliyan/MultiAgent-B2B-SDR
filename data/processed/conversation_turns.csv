76d7b1a8-47e8-4105-a7ca-54dae2228a34,3,Seller,"That's great you have that in-house capability, Alex. Many companies do. Where DeepData AI often finds its niche is in accelerating those complex data processing tasks, especially for AI/ML workloads, and providing advanced anomaly detection and predictive analytics on that data, often saving considerable compute costs and engineering time. For example, we've helped companies reduce their data processing cycles by up to 40%. Is that something that resonates at all with your current data strategy, even if it's not an immediate priority?",82,541,2026-02-19T16:12:36.912010
76d7b1a8-47e8-4105-a7ca-54dae2228a34,3,Buyer,"Look, Sarah, I appreciate the follow-up and the general overview. But ""accelerating"" and ""saving costs"" are pretty standard claims. We've looked at various solutions in the past, and frankly, the integration challenges with Kubernetes and the licensing costs have always been prohibitive. We're not looking to rip and replace what's working, and we're certainly not in a budget cycle for a new, significant data platform investment.",66,432,2026-02-19T16:12:36.912010
76d7b1a8-47e8-4105-a7ca-54dae2228a34,4,Seller,"I hear you, Alex. Integration complexity and cost are definitely top concerns for CTOs, especially within a Kubernetes ecosystem.

I came across your company and was really impressed by your focus on driving AI transformation, particularly how you're leveraging agentic automation. I wanted to reach out because we’ve been helping companies like yours significantly improve their data processing capabilities, which is often a bottleneck in scaling those AI initiatives.",70,451,2026-02-23T01:46:57.494763
c55744f6-74e8-4d4d-9f14-067f9549bdeb,1,Buyer,"Alex, thanks for the call. To be honest, we're already heavily invested in the UiPath platform, and they’re a pretty comprehensive solution for what we need.

c55744f6-74e8-4d4d-9f14-067f9549bdeb,2,Seller,"I completely understand, and UiPath is a formidable platform. That’s actually why I’m calling. We’re not looking to replace your existing automation infrastructure. Instead, think of DeepData AI as a specialized accelerator that seamlessly integrates *with* your UiPath environment. Many of our clients find that while UiPath excels at orchestrating those agentic workflows, the underlying data preparation and enrichment can become a bottleneck. We specialize in rapidly processing and structuring unstructured data, which then feeds directly into those UiPath agents, allowing them to operate more intelligently and efficiently.",88,630,2026-02-23T01:46:57.494763
c55744f6-74e8-4d4d-9f14-067f9549bdeb,2,Buyer,"""Specialized accelerator"" sounds like another layer of complexity, and potentially another cost.

c55744f6-74e8-4d4d-9f14-067f9549bdeb,3,Seller,"That’s a very valid concern, and we’ve designed DeepData AI to address that head-on. Our integration with UiPath is built on their open APIs and is incredibly straightforward, often requiring minimal to no custom code. We can ingest data from your existing sources, apply advanced AI-powered processing, and then output it in a format that your UiPath robots can consume directly, dramatically reducing pre-processing time and manual effort. Regarding cost, we typically see a substantial ROI within months by reducing the time your teams spend on data wrangling and by enabling your agents to handle more complex tasks faster. We’ve seen clients like WEX, whom you might be familiar with, achieve significant savings by streamlining their operations with solutions like ours.",121,776,2026-02-23T01:46:57.494763

c55744f6-74e8-4d4d-9f14-067f9549bdeb,4,Seller,"Precisely. Think of it this way: Your UiPath agents are the skilled workers, and DeepData AI is the ultra-efficient data preparation facility that ensures they have the highest quality raw materials to work with, instantly. We can ingest and process things like customer documents, sensor data, or unstructured text at a scale and speed that frees up your agents for higher-value decision-making and exception handling, not just data normalization. We have a number of case studies that detail how this augmentation has led to a measurable uplift in the performance of existing UiPath deployments.",94,597,2026-02-23T01:46:57.494763

What sets DeepData AI apart, especially in light of your current data challenges, is our predictive response capability. While others might focus on detection *after* an event, our AI is built to predict and proactively respond to defeat attacks before they fully materialize. It’s about shifting from reactive to predictive defense. We’re not just processing data; we’re making it actionable and predictive in a way that directly addresses the future-proofing aspect of LevelBlue’s acquisition.

We're indeed focused on our mission, but I'm not sure how a data processing solution like DeepData AI fits into our priorities.

I'm the CTO, but our CFO is the one who makes the final decisions on new purchases. And like I said, we're not really looking to add any new tools to our stack right now. I think we're going to have to pass on DeepData AI for now.",78,380,2026-03-01T23:41:46.353830

Or would you be willing to revisit this conversation in the future when your budget situation might be different?",41,229,2026-03-01T23:41:46.353830
ca0985a4-dcd6-42a4-9a04-7efe7b65d0d7,4,Buyer,"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I think we're going to have to decline. We've got a lot on our plate right now, and I don't see us revisiting this conversation anytime soon. Thank you for reaching out, but I think we're all set.",43,230,2026-03-01T23:41:46.353830
